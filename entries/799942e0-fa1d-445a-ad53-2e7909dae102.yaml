        body: Get rid of most content coordination work by building unrelated content in
          separate branches. This makes it impossible to accidentally publish
          someone else's content that was not yet meant to go into production.
          Once content in a branch is ready, use Pull Requests to review all
          additions, changes, and deletions contained in the branch side by side
          against existing published content. In your Pull Request, comment and
          iterate content as needed. When ready, apply the Pull Request and your
          content is merged into production.
