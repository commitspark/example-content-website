# Contentlab Example: Component-based Website

Follow these three steps to start using [Contentlab](https://github.com/contentlab-sh/contentlab), the Git-based
composable CMS:

1. [Copy this template](https://github.com/contentlab-sh/example-content-website/generate)
2. [Sign in with GitHub to Contentlab](https://contentlab.sh/en-us/sign-in/)
3. Select your repository copy and start editing

All content you create will be written to your repository on GitHub.

In this example, we have a content model ready to manage content for a website built from different content components.

It is meant as a starting-point for building your own content model by
[extending the schema file](schema/schema.graphql) using standard GraphQL types. (Visual model editing will be
available in the future.)
